## Step 2: Commit a file

_You created a branch! :tada:_

Creating a branch allows you to edit your project without changing the `main` branch. Now that you have a branch, it’s time to create a file and make your first commit!

**What is a commit?**: A _[commit](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)_ is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch. For more information, see "[About commits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits)".

### :keyboard: Activity: Your first commit

The following steps will guide you through the process of committing a change on GitHub. A commit records changes in renaming, changing content within, creating a new file, and any other changes made to your project. For this exercise, committing a change requires first adding a new file to your new branch.

> [!NOTE]
> `.md` is a file extension that creates a Markdown file. You can learn more about Markdown by visiting "[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)" in our docs or by taking the "[Communicating using Markdown](https://github.com/skills/communicate-using-markdown)" Skills course.

1. On the **< > Code** tab in the header menu of your repository, make sure you're on your new branch `my-first-branch`.

2. Select the **Add file** drop-down and click **Create new file**.

3. In the **Name your file...** field, enter `PROFILE.md`.

4. In the **Enter file contents here** area, copy the following content to your file:

   ```
   Welcome to my GitHub profile!
   ```

5. Click **Commit changes...** in the upper right corner above the contents box. For commits, you can enter a short commit message that describes what changes you made. This message helps others know what's included in your commit. GitHub offers a simple default message, but let's change it slightly for practice. First, enter `Add PROFILE.md` in the first text-entry field titled "Commit message".

6. In this lesson, we'll ignore the other fields and click **Commit changes**.
7. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.


## How to start a project found on GItHub!
### Step 1. Fork(on Github) and Clone(on Local) the project
``` git clone (clone using the web Url.)```
### Step 2. Navigate into the project folder
``` cd ...(file name)```
> go deep dive into the folder
``` cd "..."```
> look into file 
### Step 3. Set up your Python environment
``` conda create -n quant-trading python=3.10```
``` conda activate quant-trading```
> I prefer using conda
### Step 4. Install dependencies
- Check if there's a requirements.txt or environment.yml file. <br>
```pip install  -r requiremnet.txt```
- If no such file exists, you can manually install common packages<br>
```pip install pandas numpy matplotlib yfinance ta-lib (download by yourself)```
### Step 5. Explore the project structure
``` dir```
### Step 6. Run a sample script
``` python main.py```
